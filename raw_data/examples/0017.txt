Hi,


My friends and I are interested in 55 Columbia St E. If this unit is still available, would it be possible to sign an 8-month lease from September 2017-April 2018?


Also, is there any option for the unit to be furnished?


Look forward to hearing back from you.


Thanks,

Janice

Hey Jody,


Thanks for getting back to me!


We are a group of 4 people - we can get find a 5th person if necessary. What is the price per month for a 4 or 5 person unit? Can we do an 8-month lease? What furnishings are included for the $25/month?


Thanks,

---LANDLORD---

Hi Janice
55 Columbia we can accommodate 4 people but you could not all be in the same unit.
319 Erb I can offer you one full unit for the 4 of you I already have one girls in the unit.
Furnishings include bed, wardrobe, desk, chair and bedside table. ($25 per month).

Hey Jody,


Out of those options 16 Columbia sounds the best for us. Are utilities included in the $535/month price? & an 8-month lease is possible?


Thanks,

Hi Janice
Hydro is not included.
Yes, it is a very nice property.
