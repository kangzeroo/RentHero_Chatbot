Hello my name is Melissa Nadarajah. I'm just wondering when are we moving into 55 Columbia, waterloo. I believe its unit 1. It'll be me and 4 other girls. We also still don't know the details of how much we are paying monthly exactly and what utilities we have and don't have.

Perfect. Is the furniture extra? And when are we able to move in?
