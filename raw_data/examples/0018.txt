Would you consider doing an 8 month lease? We are a group of upper year engineering students looking to rent for our final year of school.

---LANDLORD---

Hi Holly
How many people in your group?
Thank you
Jody

---TENANT---

Hello,


We have 3 confirmed for sure (2 females and 1 male), and two that are considering but not yet committed!

---LANDLORD---

I have one co-ed unit that we can place
4 people in at 16 Columbia.
Leases are 1year.
Thank you
Jody

Hello,


Unfortunately that won't work. Do any of your properties accommodate 8 month leases?


---LANDLORD---

No, sorry Holly the owners want 1year leases.
Most students sublet the summer months.
Thank you
Jody
