Good afternoon,

I have a tour booked for this evening at 6 pm. My group and I were wondering if there's any chance we could have it moved to tomorrow (November 16) at 6 pm. Only 2 people from our group would be able to make it tonight.

Please let me know!

Thanks,

Monica

Hi Monica
We will need to reschedule for a later date.
The owner has not confirmed September vacancies.
Thank you

Hello Jody,

I already spoke with someone on the phone and I have an appointment set up for tomorrow at 6 pm to have a tour of the building.

Please advise

Monica
