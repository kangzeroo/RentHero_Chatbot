Hello, my name is Ryan. I am interested in your room for rent and was wondering if it is exclusively student rental? I am a 24 year old framer and am looking to move by the end of the month. Feel free to contact me at 519-949-2372 or via email. Thanks, look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Ryan
This is a Student Building exclusively during September to End of April.
We offer sublets during the summer to people who are ether students or not.
How long do you need a place for?
We have 4 Buildings 3 are student and one is mixed students and families.
Thank you
Jody

I'm not sure how long I need a place for, but I need to move by July 1.  I was looking for a semi-permanent residence or 1 year, but if I am unable to find anything somewhere else would you possibly have something available for a limited time?
