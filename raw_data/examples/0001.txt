Good Evening,
A few girls and I were looking into your apartments and were wondering how much rent is and what it all includes.

Thank you,
Laura Winters

---LANDLORD---

Hi Laura
Our 5 Bedroom units range in price from $500-$535 per month.
Each Unit is slightly different, 2 of the units have everything included except parking.
The other one does not include hydro.
Internet is included and ensuite laundry as well as 2 bathrooms per unit.
Let me know when you are available and we can book a viewing.
Thank you
Jody
