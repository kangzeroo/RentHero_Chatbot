Hello,

We are 3-4 UWaterloo students admitted fall 2017 and are looking for an accommodation. Came across '150 Erb St E, Waterloo, ON N2J 1M4, Canada' on Kijiji.

Is this property still available ?
If yes, please let us know the cost if we want our bedrooms, living room and kitchen to be furnished.

Thanks and Regards,
Nikhil Swatantra
